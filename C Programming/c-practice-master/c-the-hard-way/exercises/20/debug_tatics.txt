Debug Tatics

1. You can't debug code by just looking at it.
2. Repeat the bug with an automated test.
3. Run the program under a debugger and valgrind and lint.
4. Find the backtrace and print out all of the variables on the path.
5. Once you fix it, add macro check() from "dbg.h" to prevent it.
6. Enable core dump files on system, and for specific program.

## Binary Search

Binary search is a searching algorithm that cuts a list in half on every iteration that it does
not find the value that is being searched for. It compares the target value to the middle element
between a minimum and maximum limit, and it alters the minimum and maximum based on whether or
not the searching element is higher or lower than the middle element.


#### Binary Search Run Time

Binary Search run time is O(log2 n):

|     Input     | Worse Case Run Time  |
|:-------------:|:--------------------:|
|	   100  	|           7  		   |
| 4,000,000,000 |    	   32          |
